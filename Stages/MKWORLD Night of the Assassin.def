 ;This is how much the camera will move vertically towards the

 ;Typically .2 for normal-sized backgrounds. You may need to pull this
 ;value up for taller backgrounds.

 ;Minimum vertical distance the highest player has to be from the floor,

 ;result.

yscale = .3

 ;This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
 ;visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is
 ;the middle level. Both represent y-coordinates of the player.
 ;A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
 ;and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
 ;faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
 ;shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the

[Music]

 ;0 will play a random audio track. For example, to play
 ;track 3 from a music CD, use:

 ;Adjust the volume. 0 is normal, negative for softer, and
