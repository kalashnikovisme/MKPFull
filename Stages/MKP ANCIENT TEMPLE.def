; Definition of Ancient Neowave stage
; *** denotes values you should change/check for each stage.
; The term "background" is used to mean both backgrounds and foregrounds.

[Camera]
 ;Camera starting position: Usually 0 for both
startx = 0
starty = 0

 ;Left and right bound of camera
 ;You may want to fiddle a bit with these values to make sure the
 ;background doesn't move too far or too little
 ;***
boundleft = -224
boundright = 224

 ;High and low bound of camera
 ;High is a negative number. Make is more negative if you want to
 ;camera to be able to move higher.
 ;Low should usually be 0.
 ;If omitted, defaults to -25 and 0 respectively
 ;***
boundhigh = -8
boundlow = 0

 ;This is how much the camera will move vertically towards the
 ;highest player. Valid values are from 0 to 1. A value of 0 will mean
 ;the camera does not move up at all. A value of 1 will makes the camera
 ;follow the highest player.
 ;Typically .2 for normal-sized backgrounds. You may need to pull this
 ;value up for taller backgrounds.
verticalfollow = .08

 ;Minimum vertical distance the highest player has to be from the floor,
 ;before the camera starts to move up to follow him. For extremely
 ;tall stages, a floor tension of about 20-30 coupled with a
 ;vertical-follow of .8 allows the camera to follow the action.
floortension = 0

 ;Horizontal distance player is from edge before camera starts to move
 ;left or right. Typically 50 or 60.
tension = 70

[PlayerInfo]

 ;Player 1 starting coordinates.
 ;p1startx is typically -70 and p2startx is 70.
 ;p1starty and p1startz should be 0.
p1startx = -70          ;Starting x coordinates
p1starty = 0            ;Starting y coordinates
p1startz = 0            ;Starting z coordinates
p1facing = 1            ;Direction player faces: 1=right, -1=left

 ;Don't change these values.

[Scaling]
 ;No need to change these values

 ;Distance from left/right edge of screen that player can move to
 ;Typically 15

screenright = 30   ;Right edge

;--------------------------------------------------------
[StageInfo]
 ;Z offset for drawing
 ;Adjust this value to move the ground level up/down in the screen.
 ;It's the position where the players stand at.
 ;Up - smaller, Down - larger
 ;***
zoffset = 218

 ;Leave this at 1. It makes the players face each other
autoturn = 1

 ;Set the following to 1 to have the background be reset between
 ;rounds.
resetBG = 1

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Shadow]
 ;This controls the darkness of the shadow. Valid values range
 ;from 0 (lightest) to 256 (darkest). Defaults to 128 if omitted.
intensity = 0

 ;This is the shadow color given in r,g,b. Valid values for each
 ;range from 0 (lightest) to 255 (darkest).
 ;Defaults to 0,0,0 if omitted.
 ;intensity and color's effects add up to give the final shadow
 ;result.
color = 128,128,128

 ;This is the scale factor of the shadow. Use a big scale factor
 ;to make the shadow longer. You can use a NEGATIVE scale factor
 ;to make the shadow fall INTO the screen.
 ;Defaults to 0.4 if omitted.
yscale = .2

 ;This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
 ;visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is
 ;the middle level. Both represent y-coordinates of the player.
 ;A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
 ;and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
 ;faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
 ;shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the
 ;ground. If omitted, defaults to no level effects (shadow is
 ;always fully visible).
fade.range = -400,-100

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Reflection]
 ;Intensity of reflection (from 0 to 256). Set to 0 to have no
 ;reflection. Defaults to 0.
intensity = 0

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Music]
 ;Put a filename for a MOD, MP3 or MIDI here, or just leave it
 ;blank if you don't want music. If an invalid filename is
 ;given, then no music will play. To play CD audio, put
 ;the track number followed by ".da". Using a track number of
 ;0 will play a random audio track. For example, to play
 ;track 3 from a music CD, use:
 ;  bgmusic = 3.da
;This is the Mp3 version of the song. Add a ; to the front of it to
;switch to ADX.
bgmusic = sound/Good (5).mp3
;This is the ADX version of the song. Remove the ; in front of it to
;switch to ADX.
bgmusic = sound/Good (5).mp3


 ;Adjust the volume. 0 is normal, negative for softer, and
 ;positive for louder (only for mp3, mods and CDA)
bgvolume = 255
